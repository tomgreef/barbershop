## Step by step commands in CLI for API folder
1. `npm init`
This command will create our backend with Mongo and Express.
2. `npm install express mongoose`
This will install express and mongoose, which is a third party that will allow us to modify the mongo db easily.
3. `npm install --save-dev nodemon`
This will only be installed in the development environment. Nodemon will refresh the page everytime we make a change.

## API creation
We will start by modifying the index.js file within the API folder to start creating the server with Express. After that we will need to create the models and controllers that will be used in the routes.
